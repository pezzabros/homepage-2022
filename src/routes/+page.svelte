	Hey there, I am Daniele.
  <br><br>
	For more than a decade I've been helping companies and organizations turn ideas into innovative digital solutions and developed interactive applications that can clarify complexity, improve decision making or simply make user interaction with data just a little bit better.	
	<br><br>
	I think of myself as a <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mindset-for-innovation-with-data-science-fc51605a4867">"generalized specialist"</a>, combining the skills of a software engineer with the mindset of a designer and a researcher.

  <div class="section-title">What do i do</div>
	Currently I lead the development team at <a href="https://www.bestiario.org" target="_blank">Bestiario</a>, where we create data-driven innovation projects for companies and organizations.
	<br/><br/>
	Whether devising a final product or a proof-of-concept, I oversee and contribute to the entire creative process, from the initial research to the design and implementation of each project.
	<br/><br/>
	In the past few years, I:
	<ul>
		<li>Assisted Banco Santander in the creation of a new way to communicate with data. As part of this process, we developed the Santander Annual Review in <a href="https://www.santanderannualreport.com/2021/" target="_blank">2021</a> and <a href="https://www.santanderannualreport.com/2022/" target="_blank">2022</a>, a digital storytelling solution with a strong focus on data visualization. The 2021 report was awarded "Best online annual report" at the <a href="https://www.digitalimpactawards.com/europe/past-winners/2022/" target="_blank">Digital Impact Awards</a>.</li>
		
		<li>Lead the creation of open data portals for international institutions such as <a href="https://www4.wider.unu.edu/" target="_blank">United Nations University</a>, <a href="https://goingdigital.oecd.org/datakitchen/" target="_blank">OECD</a> and Municipality of Barcelona. These portals enable users from across the world to access and visualize crucial social and economic indicators for a wide variety of applications.</li>

		<li>Defined and prototyped innovative software for the digital design of apparel and footwear on account of a top global fashion brand.</li>

		<li>Experimented new ways to interact and present data using modern artificial intelligence solutions.</li>

	</ul>
	<br />

	I have a strong interest in projects that use technology for social good. During my career I was involved in inspiring initiatives such as <a href="https://www.data4chan.ge/" target="_blank">Data4Change</a> and European Hub for Civic Engagement. Among other projects, I contributed to the creation of <a href="https://www.data4chan.ge/our-work/al-bedaya" target="_blank">"Al Bedaya"</a>, a digital toolkit that supports orphan children in Jordan facing social stigma and discrimination.

	<br/><br />

	In the context of my academic research I have continuously strived to maintain my connections to the education sector. I have taught in MA programs offered by the University of Florence and Università IUAV of Venice and gave lectures for various institutions.

	<div class="section-title">Research</div>
	I spent several formative years working as a researcher at the <a href="http://www.micc.unifi.it/" target="_blank">Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC)</a> at the University of Florence and I subsequently transferred to the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/gti" target="_blank">Interactive Technologies Group</a> at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.
	During this time I was involved in several R&D projects experimenting with innovative human-computer interaction and machine learning techniques in the field of cultural heritage, medicine, and smart cities.
  <br><br>
  Here are some of the research challenges I took on:

  <ul>
		<li>How can Natural Interaction and Virtual Reality (VR) be used to improve training in emergency medicine?</li>
    <li>Can the installation of computer vision or other location sensors be applied to enrich visitors’ experience in a museum?</li>
    <li>Is there a way for social network analysis to help us discover the underlying "vibes" of a city?</li>
    <li>Would a crowdsource approach help to improve video recommendation algorithms?</li>

  </ul>
  
  The work I have done has been published and presented in leading international conferences organized by ACM and IEEE, academic journals and an <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-61036-8" target="_blank">edited book</a> published by Springer.
