<section id="intro">
	Hey there, I am Daniele.
  <br><br>
  For more than 10 years I've been helping companies and organizations shaping innovative ideas and data challanges into digital solutions that can clarify complexity, improve decision making or simply make somobody's life just a little bit better.
  <br><br>

  I like to consider myself a <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mindset-for-innovation-with-data-science-fc51605a4867">"generalized specialist"</a>, combining the skills of a software engineer with the mindset of a designer and a researcher.

  <div class="section-title">What do i do</div>

	I am currently collaborating with Bestiario on data-driven innovation projects for companies and organizations,
	such as United Nations University, Telefonica I+D, Satellogic and Seat. 
	<br /><br />
	He has also taught in MA programs offered by the University of Florence and Università IUAV of Venice.
	<br /><br />

	He has a strong interest in projects that use technology for social good. He has participated,
	among others, in initiatives such as Data4Change and European Hub for Civic Engagement.

	<div class="section-title">Research</div>

  I spent several formative years working as a
	researcher at the <a href="http://www.micc.unifi.it/">Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC)</a>, in Florence first and at the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/gti">Interactive Technologies Group</a> in Universitat
	Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, where I was involved in several R&D projects experimenting innovative human-computer
	interaction and multimedia analysis techniques in the field of cultural heritage, medicine, and smart
	cities. 
  <br><br>
  Here are some of the research challanges I took on:

  <ul>
		<li>How can we use Natural Interaction and Virtualy Reality (VR) to improve training in emergency medicine?</li>
    <li>Can we use computer vision or other location sensors to enrich visitors experience in a museum?</li>
    <li>Can social network analysis help us discover the underlying "vibes" of a city?</li>
    <li>Would a crowdsource approach help to improve video recommendation algorithims?</li>

  </ul>
  
  The work I have done with my teams has been published and presented in leading international conferences organized by ACM and IEEE, academic journals
	and an <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-61036-8">edited book</a> published by Springer.
